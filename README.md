# Image-classification-A-Z-do-it-yourself

Hi, This is Achutha Prakash, I am attaching codes which I've worked on and I feel this will help all budding engineers who wish 
to do their first Image classification project.

Here the classification is done among daily wishing photos against Normal shared photos from my mobile. about 800 photos where used 
and the same where resized to 30X30 pixels using CV2

All libraries used are open source.

Initially classification done using KNN classifier with random number of neighbours, then checked for better number of neghbors and again
trained to achieve about 75% accuracy.

Next I used tensor-flow to do the same project by using convolutions and pooling to again reduce the shape of arrays and then I tried
Dense nural networks so as to achieve better classification results slowly

you can play around with the numbers, models etc to achieve better results, there is a complete guide to prepare data, and also the data
file I've attached for some one to refer.

I am sure that this project will help someone who needs to do classification from scratch data but don't have sufficient experience.

Thank you all.
